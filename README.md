# Neural Machine Translation Model

This repository contains a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model implemented in Python. The model translates text from English to Danish using deep learning techniques.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/VoiceLessQ/Neural-Machine-Translation-Model.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Neural-Machine-Translation-Model


3. Download the GloVe word embeddings:
- Download the `glove.6B.50d.txt` file from the official GloVe website (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
- Place the `glove.6B.50d.txt` file in the `glove` directory of the project.

## Usage

1. Prepare the data:
- Place your English and Danish text data files in the `data` directory. Make sure they are named `english.txt` and `danish.txt`, respectively.
- Each line in the data files should contain a single sentence.

2. Train the NMT model:
- Run the following command to train the model:
  ```
  python train.py
  ```
- The model will be trained using the provided data files and the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings.

3. Translate text:
- After training, you can use the trained model to translate English text to Danish.
- Open the `translate.py` file and modify the `input_text` variable with the desired English text to be translated.
- Run the following command to perform the translation:
  ```
  python translate.py
  ```
- The translated text will be displayed in the console.

4. Experiment and customize:
- Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, or datasets to improve the translation performance.
- You can modify the code in the `train.py` file to customize the model architecture or training process.

## Glove info
The glove.6B refers to the GloVe word embeddings dataset. In our code, we specifically use the glove.6B.50d.txt file, which contains word vectors of dimension 50. These pre-trained word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and provide valuable semantic information for our Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model.

By using the GloVe word embeddings, we can represent words as numerical vectors that carry semantic meaning. These embeddings are trained on extensive text corpora, allowing them to capture the contextual information and semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence patterns.

In our code, the load_glob_embedding() function loads the glove.6B.50d.txt file and creates an embedding matrix. This matrix is then utilized to initialize the word embedding layer of our NMT model. Incorporating these pre-trained word embeddings helps our model learn and generalize the translation task more effectively.

It's important to note that the glove.6B.50d.txt file represents just one variant of the GloVe word embeddings. There are other variants available, such as glove.6B.100d.txt, glove.6B.200d.txt, and glove.6B.300d.txt, which correspond to word vectors of different dimensions (100, 200, and 300, respectively). The choice of which variant to use depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of your NMT model and dataset.
