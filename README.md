Neural Machine Translation Model
This repository contains a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model implemented in Python. The model is designed to translate text from English to Danish using advanced deep learning techniques.

Overview
The Neural Machine Translation Model is built to facilitate accurate and efficient translation between English and Danish languages. By leveraging the power of deep learning, the model achieves high-quality translation results. It is trained on a large corpus of English and Danish text data, allowing it to learn the intricate patterns and structures of both languages.

Features
Accurate and reliable translation from English to Danish
Deep learning architecture for enhanced language understanding
Support for handling complex sentence structures and idiomatic expressions
Efficient and scalable implementation
Usage
To use the Neural Machine Translation Model, follow these steps:

# Neural Machine Translation Model

This repository contains a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model implemented in Python. The model translates text from English to Danish using deep learning techniques.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/VoiceLessQ/Neural-Machine-Translation-Model.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Neural-Machine-Translation-Model


3. Download the GloVe word embeddings:
- Download the `glove.6B.50d.txt` file from the official GloVe website (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
- Place the `glove.6B.50d.txt` file in the `glove` directory of the project.

## Usage

1. Prepare the data:
- Place your English and Danish text data files in the `data` directory. Make sure they are named `english.txt` and `danish.txt`, respectively.
- Each line in the data files should contain a single sentence.

2. Train the NMT model:
- Run the following command to train the model:
  ```
  python train.py
  ```
- The model will be trained using the provided data files and the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings.

3. Translate text:
- After training, you can use the trained model to translate English text to Danish.
- Open the `translate.py` file and modify the `input_text` variable with the desired English text to be translated.
- Run the following command to perform the translation:
  ```
  python translate.py
  ```
- The translated text will be displayed in the console.

4. Experiment and customize:
- Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, or datasets to improve the translation performance.
- You can modify the code in the `train.py` file to customize the model architecture or training process.
